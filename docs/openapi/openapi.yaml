      summary: WebSocket connection for realtime events
      description: >
        Establish a WebSocket connection to receive realtime broadcasts of new events.

        **Message Format:**
        The server sends messages using the WebSocketMessage schema with different types:

        - **Connection**: Sent immediately after connection establishment
        - **New Event**: Broadcast when new events are created across the Synapse
        - **Error**: Sent when WebSocket-related errors occur

        **Authentication:**
        The WebSocket connection inherits the authentication from the HTTP request that initiated it.
        Clients should include appropriate authorization headers in the initial HTTP request.

        **Reconnection:**
        Clients should implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts.
        The server may close connections periodically for maintenance.

        **Example Messages:**

        Connection confirmation:
        ```json
        {
          "type": "connection",
          "message": "Connected to meNexus Synapse",
          "synapseInfo": {
            "publicKey": "02abcdef...",
            "name": "My Synapse",

          },
          "timestamp": "2023-01-01T00:00:00.001Z"
        }
        ```

        New event broadcast:
        ```json
        {
          "type": "newEvent",
          "event": {
            "eventId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
            "agentPublicKey": "02abcdef...",
