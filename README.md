## ‚ùì What is meNexus?

**meNexus** is a decentralized social networking platform designed to empower individuals and communities by fostering meaningful connections, autonomy, and collaboration. At its core, meNexus operates through interconnected nodes called **Synapses**, enabling users to create, share, and interact without centralized authorities.

Synapses form a mesh of evolving, user-hosted communities.
